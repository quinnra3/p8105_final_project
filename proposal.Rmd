### **Project Title: Rat Reign: Unveiling the Truth Behind NYC's Rodent Infestation**

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a project proposal for the following team members: Wynter Henry (wch2124), Quinn Anderson (qra2000), and Laylah Jones (lsj2122). We are proposing to investigate the presence of rats in the city to determine if they really rule the Big Apple. We will utilize data sourced from Transit, NYC Rodent Inspection data, and NYC borough data to investigate where rodent inspection and activity is most prevalent. Our hope is to add further insight into a rat-tastic issue the city faces. 

In conducting our research, some important questions we would like to explore are:

1. What is the overall frequency of rat sightings? 
2. What is the distribution of rat sightings across different boroughs in NYC?
3. Are there any seasonal trends or patterns in rat sightings?
4. Is there any correlation between monthly collection of garbage tonnages that the NYC Department of Sanitation collects and the prevalence of rat sightings?
5. Which borough has the most monthly reported rat sightings?

The intended final products for this project consist of a comprehensive report summarizing our findings, interactive data visualizations, as well as a project website. Our planned analyses/visualizations include a geospatial analysis to map the frequency of rat sightings across the different boroughs, a comparative analysis of rat sightings in relation to garbage collection, and interactive visualizations to illustrate trends and patterns in rat infestation.  Potential challenges of this project include aligning data sources, determining if additional/different datasets are necessary to answer the questions we proposed.
