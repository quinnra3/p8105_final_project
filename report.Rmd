## Motivation and Questions 
As all New Yorkers know, there is a serious rat problem in the city. We see them scurrying on the subway tracks and running around street corners. For this project, we wanted to look in to the rat frequency in New York. How many rats are there in New York? Which borough has the most rats? Is rat frequency associated with trash tonnage? Our project answers these questions in the following analysis. 


## Related Work

The New York City rat problem is constantly covered in news outlets, and we wanted to further explore this issue to see if the problem is really as severe as it is presented to be. Specific articles that inspired us were "New Yorkâ€™s Rats Have Already Won" by Xochitl Gonzalez published in the *The Atlantic* and "There Are Now 3 Million Rats in NYC, a 50% Increase Since 2010" published by MMPC. After looking at NYC Health's open data, we found a dataset detailing the numbers behind New York's rat problem.


## Data

We obtained two of our datasets (Rodent Inspection Data and DSNY Monthly Tonnage Data 2023) from NYC Health's open data website. We cleaned the data by removing values and columns that were not necessary for our research question and data analysis. The main function we used for this was select() and mutate(), where we were easily able to remove and change columns. We obtained our third dataset (Transit App Rat Reports) from the NYC Subway Rat Detector; we were not able to combine this dataset with the other two due to size. This dataset was already tidy, and we opted not to make any further changes to this dataset. 


## Exploratory Analysis

For our visualizations, we decided to make graphs that addressed five questions:
- What is the overall frequency of rat sightings?
- What is the distribution of rat sightings across different boroughs in NYC?
- Are there any seasonal trends or patterns in rat sightings?
- Is there any correlation between monthly collection of garbage tonnages that the NYC Department of Sanitation collects and the prevalence of rat sightings?
- Which borough has the most monthly reported rat sightings?


## Statistical Testing: ANOVA 

We conducted two ANOVA tests to determine if the means between variables longitude, latitude, refuse collected (tons), recyclable paper collected (tons), and recyclable metal, glass, plastic, and beverage cartons (tons) are different. Two separate ANOVA tests were conducted to evaluate longitude against the trash variables, and latitude against the trash variables. Based on the results, the p-values of all three variables (`refusetonscollected`, `papertonscollected`, and `mgptonscollected`) are smaller than 0.05 so we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the means are different for both the longitude and latitude ANOVA tests. 


## Discussion and Conclusion 

Based on the exploratory analysis and the ANOVA test, we can conclude that the rat problem in New York City is significant. The two boroughs that have the highest rat frequency and subway sightings are Manhattan and Brooklyn, and the borough with the least rat frequency and subway sightings is Staten Island. While the rat presence in Manhattan and Brooklyn was expected, we were surprised that Staten Island had a significantly lower rat population compared to the other four boroughs. Along with these findings, we also determined that rat frequency appears to be seasonal, with more rats being sighted between July to October compared to other months out of the year. In terms of the relationship between trash tonnage and rat frequency, based on the boxplot we constructed, there does not appear to be a strong association between the two variables.
