### P8105 Final Project Proposal

Project title: Rats in the City

This is a project proposal for the following team members: Wynter Henry
(UNI ), Quinn Anderson (UNI qra2000), and Laylah Jones (UNI ). We are
proposing to investigate the presence of rats in the city to determine
if they really rule the big apple. We will utilize data sourced from
Transit, NYC Rodent Inspection data, and NYC borough data to investigate
where rodent inspection and activity is most prevalent \[add data source
links\]. Our hope is to add further insight into a rat-tastic issue the
city faces.

The intended final products for this project are summary report of our
findings as well as a project website. Potential challenges of this
project include aligning data sources….. etc.
