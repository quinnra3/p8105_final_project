First, define teams and propose project. This proposal should be a
half-page to a page in length and include:

- The group members (names and UNIs)
- The tentative project title
- The motivation for this project
- The intended final products
- The anticipated data sources
- The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges
- The planned timeline

This is intended to describe a project that is in the planning stages.
Only one team member should submit this proposal via Canvas.

Please also submit (only once per team) a list of your teamâ€™s UNIs using
this form. Doing so will help us keep track of teams
